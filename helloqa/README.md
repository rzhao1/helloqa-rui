Hello World QA Pipeline

#Installation Instructions#
Although the HelloQA pipeline works "out-of-the-box," you still have to install the Gutenberg index seperately. To install the Gutenberg index, first download it from [here](https://github.com/downloads/oaqa/helloqa/guten.tar.gz "guten.tar.gz"), and then simply untar and decompress it into the data directory inside your HelloQA project.
